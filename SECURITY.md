# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support and apply security patches to the following versions:

   None, because there are no releases.

<!-- | Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| 1.x     | ✅        |
| 0.x     | ❌        | -->

Ensure you are using a supported version to receive the latest security updates.
If you are using an unsupported version, you can either update or patch
vulnerabilities your self. For assistance with updating or applying patches on
the current version, feel free to [contact us](https://github.com/ProjNull/Praeteritum#support).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there are any vulnerabilities in **Praeteritum**, don't hesitate to _report them_.

1. Use any of the
   [support channels](https://github.com/ProjNull/Praeteritum#support) in the README.
2. Describe the vulnerability.

   If you have a fix, that is most welcome -- please attach or summarize it
   in your message!

3. We will evaluate the vulnerability and, if necessary, release a fix or
   mitigating steps to address it. We will contact you to let you know the
   outcome, and will credit you in the report.

   Please **do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until a fix is released!

4. Once we have either a) published a fix, or b) declined to address the
   vulnerability for whatever reason, you are free to publicly disclose it.
